## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-auth-app.git
cd fullstack-auth-app
````

---

### 2. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on: `http://localhost:5173` (or port set in Vite/CRA)

---

### 3. Backend Setup (Express + MySQL)

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file in `server/`:

```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=yourdbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

#### Then start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Runs on: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔐 Auth Flow

* ✅ Login with email & password
* ✅ JWT stored in localStorage
* ✅ Protected `/dashboard` route (client)
* ✅ `/me` API (server) requires JWT in `Authorization` header
* ✅ Logout clears token

---

## 🧪 Test Credentials

You can seed a test user in MySQL manually:

```sql
INSERT INTO user (name, email, password, phone)
VALUES ('Test User', 'test@example.com', '$2a$10$hashedPasswordHere', '9999999999');
```

> Use bcrypt to hash password like `bcrypt.hash('password123', 10)`.

### ✅ Tips to Finalize:
1. Replace:
   - `https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-auth-app.git`
   - Screenshot URLs if available
   - Database credentials (keep safe, don't push `.env`)
2. Upload it in your root folder:
   - Place `README.md` at `your-project/README.md`

Would you like me to auto-generate `.gitignore`, `package.json`, or folder templates too?
